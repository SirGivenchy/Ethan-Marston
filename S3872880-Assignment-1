Hey my name is Ethan I am 18 years of age and I love anything to do with technology, Im always gaming you'll find me on Valorant most of the time popping heads :O. Im 100% full Australian not much interesting about me cant speak any other languages you'll catch me building computers or having a sleep I play cricket aswell love me some cricket i play regularly and have been now for 8 years now.

My interests from IT go way back when I got my first Xbox360 and Ipodtouch, always been a gamer loved Black ops 2 still to this day my favourite game. Even at school i couldnt get on a computer without having to get on cool maths games for the 70 minutes lesson. Im so passionate about technology and how its going to effect our future, technology is evolving rapidly and i would love to be apart of the future. I plan on being around the world of gaming and find IT is the best start for me in learning all the basic fundamentals.
I choose RMIT beacuse i strongly believe this is my best opportunity in what i seek for my future. I highly appreciate all the staff Ive meet so far and think they a highly educated in this field and cant wait to see what this 12 weeks as in store for me and the rest of the class. I plan on learning all about the fundamentals that goes into our fast paced technology filled world.
